/// @class     TCPSocket
/// @brief     A wrapper around a TCP socket.
/// @details   The TCPSocket class provides simple methods for connecting,
///            sending, and receiving stream data over a network.
///
/// @remarks   If the TCPSocket is constructed using the default constructor
///            or with the AF_UNSPEC address family, socket creation is
///            defered until the connection is opened to allow multiple
///            address families from a call to getaddrinfo to be tried. As a
///            consequence, none of the properties that set socket options,
///            nor the Socket property will work until a connection is opened
///            for AF_UNSPEC TCPSockets.
