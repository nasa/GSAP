/// @class      TCPServer
/// @brief      A wrapper around a TCP socket for servers
/// @details    The TCPSocketServer class provides methods for creating
///             sockets meant to be servers, sending, and receiving
///             stream data over a network.
/// @remarks    This class is meant to be used in conjunction with the
///             TCPSocket class. The TCPSocket class is meant for creating
///             client sockets.
