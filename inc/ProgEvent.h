 *   @brief     Prognostic Event Class used to handle storage, access, and updating of the data
 *              associated with a specific prognostic event (Example: End of life, end of
 *              discharge). This data includes the following:
 *              1. Meta Information from ProgMeta
 *              2. timeOfEvent with uncertainty: When the event occurs
 *              3. probMatrix with uncertainty: The probability that the event has occured at
 *                 different timestamps
 *              4. occurrenceMatrix: A collection of samples in a simulation for different
 *                 timestamps- if the event has occured for each sample. This is the most detailed
 *                 representation of uncertainty. probMatrix can be calculated from this
 *
 *   @note      In many cases there will be only one event (End of life).
 *   @note      In many cases timeOfEvent will be the only parameter that is used. probMatrix and
 *              occurrenceMatrix is for advanced users.
