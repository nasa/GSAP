     * A collection of message subcribers that receive messages based on their
     * message Id's.
     *
     * @remarks
     * For each message that is published, the set of subscribers for that
     * message is determined, and each subscriber in that set is called in its
     * own {@code std::async} instance. The behavior of those instances is
     * controlled by the launch policy specified when the message bus is
     * constructed.
     *
     * @remarks
     * By default, the {@code std::launch::async} policy is specified, which
     * launches each {@code std::async} instance on its own thread. In this
     * mode, no active management of the message bus is required, as message
     * procesing will proceed automatically on the threads spawned by
     * {@code std::async}, and the message bus will automatically clean up the
     * completed futures.
     *
     * @remarks
     * If {@code std::launch::defered} is specified (either alone or as part of
     * a bitmask), the end user must periodically call {@code wait} or one of
     * its alternates to ensure that the futures representing calls to
     * individual subscribers are eventually executed. If
     * {@code std::launch::defered} is specified alone, the MessageBus will only
     * make progres when one of the message bus's wait methods is called. If
     * {@code std::launch::defered} is specified as part of a mask that includes
     * other options, it is implementation-defined whether the bus will process
     * messages without user intervention.
     *
     * @remarks
     * The order in which subscribers are notified of new messages is not well
     * defined. In the case where {@code std::launch::async} is used, all
     * standard caveats about thread execution ordering apply. In other cases,
     * the message bus may still make decisions to improve execution efficiency,
     * such as using a stack to keep track of futures, which would result in a
     * "depth first" execution of message callback rather than execution in the
     * order messages are published.
