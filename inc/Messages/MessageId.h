     * The set of pre-defined message identifiers. Any integer in the range of
     * uint64_t may be a valid identifier. Any entity dealing with messages
     * should not treat this list as exhaustive.
     *
     * @remarks The two most significant bytes are used to encode the source of
     * an enum value. End users should pick a value that does not conflict with
     * any other source that they are using. Built in enum values are given the
     * prefix "0x6272" (NASA on a touch-tone phone).
     *
     * @remarks The third most significant byte encodes the payload of the
     * message as described in the following tables. All scalar payloads are
     * serialized directly. All vector payloads are serialized as a 16-bit
     * unsigned integer describing the number of elements followed by the
     * elements themselves.
     *
